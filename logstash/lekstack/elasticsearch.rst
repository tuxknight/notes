Elasticsearch
================

Cluster
---------

An elasticsearch cluster is a collection of one or more nodes that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.

A cluster is identified by a unique name which by default is "elasticsearch".  This name is important because a node can only be part of a cluster if the node is set up to join the cluster by its name.
